            Dear all, <br /> Our love story began in 2018, with no idea we would
            be here over six years later, more madly in love with each other
            than ever.
          </p>
          <p className="">
            We are happy to share with our family and closest friends the first
            day of the rest of our lives
          </p>
          <p className="">
            February 1, 2025 will mark the beginning of our family; #Torespies,
            and we want you all to experience Medell√≠n, Colombia. Which is a
            country that is so special to us.
          </p>
          <p className="">
            In this website, you can find everything you need for our wedding:
            FAQs, how to get there, where to stay, what to do, what to wear.
          </p>
          <p className="">We are happy to have you join us! See you soon!</p>
